<p>
  According to City of Amsterdam, the details of the tourist tax are shown in Figure 1. However, from 2024 the tourist tax will rise to <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/news/budget-2024/">12. 5%</a> . And according to Statista, we learnt the average cost of an overnight stay in Amsterdam in Figure 2.

</p>
<p>
  As the event will take place in May, we refer to the average price of €294 per night in May 2023, and we assume that all 30,000 visitors will stay at the hotel. Then there will be two limiting scenarios.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the first case, each person is in a separate room: <br> (294 * 12.5% + 3) * 30000 * 7 = 8,347,500
  </li>
  <li>The second scenario is where everyone is sharing a room with someone else (double occupancy): <br> (294 * 12.5% + 3 * 2) * 15000 * 7 = 4,488,750
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It is assumed that Amsterdam will receive between €4,488,750 and €8,347,500 in tourist tax.
