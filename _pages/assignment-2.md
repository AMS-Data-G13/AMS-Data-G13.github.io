The Municipality is worried that the canal- and support boats might pollute the air with their diesel engines. Since the Municipality wants to create ideal conditions for the swimmers so they can set records (always nice for PR), it is your task to figure out if their concern is warranted and what should or could be done to improve conditions. Next to that, Amsterdam wants to advertise this event as a Neutral Energy Event©™® (NEE). 

### - How many of the canal boats currently in use are diesel/fossil fuel driven and how many boats are electrical driven?

The newest data from the Grachten Monitor (2022) from the municipality of Amsterdam indicates that there is a total of **7350 pleasure and recreational boats mooring in the city**. This does not include the 10280 Pleasure boats from outside Amsterdam and, in marinas that do not moor at night on the Amsterdam inland waterway. 

Out of the total of 7350 boats, **4854 are fossil fuel** driven, **2276 are electric or environmental** and **220 boats are hybrid** meaning that have both electric and combustion motors. According to the Grachten Monitor 2022, 34.0% of the current fleet is either electric or hybrid powered.

### - Are there peak times for the canal boats?

According to the Gractenmonitor **the peak weeks of the year are 15th and 16th**, with a gnereal high season on summer between weeks 15th and 38th of the year. The peak day is **Saturday follow by Sunday and Friday**. And the peak hours are between **13:00 and 15:00** in the afternoon.

The average weekly pattern shows a gradual increase from Monday to the weekend, with a peak on Saturdays (figure 2). Compared to the previous sailing season, in addition to an increase in activity, there is also a greater spread over the week.

In the same period, July to August 2022, the daily rhythm of manned passenger shipping shows that activities start from 8:00 AM and increase to a peak period between 2:00 PM and 6:00 PM (Figure 4). Then the activity decreases again. Virtually no activity takes place between 24:00 and 08:00. Compared to recent years, there is more sailing, especially in the evening.

On August 12 to 14, 2022 it was dry and the maximum temperature averaged 31 degrees Celsius. Almost 50,000 passages were observed at all locations together (figure 5). The highest number of passages per hour was measured between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM. On Saturday it was busier than on Friday and Sunday (20-25% more passages).

### - Try to compare the energy use of the canal boats to some other activities in the city. Use canal boats more or less energy in relation to their carbon footprint compared to these other activities?

### - Would you consider it economically feasible?

### - How many support boats and vehicles are needed for the Paralympics event only?

### - If only clean energy can be used, how many solar panels or wind turbines are needed?

### - Is it possible to accommodate these facilities within the city?

### - Would their be any effect on the water quality if there are less/no canal boats using fossil fules?
