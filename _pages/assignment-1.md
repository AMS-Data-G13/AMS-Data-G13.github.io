It is feasible for Amsterdam to organize swimming competitions in the canal district. 

Although the canals are not officially declared a source of water for swimming in the Netherlands, the Amsterdam City Swim now takes place every September, with participants raising money for Stitching ALS Nederland (the Dutch ALS foundation). Participants in the Classic Swim (2.1 kilometers) will be taken to Keizersgracht on a special bus. The start of the Classic Swim is at Keizergracht 663, after which the participants will swim together across the canal to the Marineterrein in Amsterdam (Figure 1). Of course, no boats are allowed on this route during the city swim.
