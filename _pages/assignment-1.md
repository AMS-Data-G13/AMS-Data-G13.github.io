It is feasible for Amsterdam to organize swimming competitions in the canal district. 

Although the canals are not officially declared a source of water for swimming in the Netherlands, the Amsterdam City Swim now takes place every September, with participants raising money for Stitching ALS Nederland (the Dutch ALS foundation). Participants in the Classic Swim (2.1 kilometers) will be taken to Keizersgracht on a special bus. The start of the Classic Swim is at Keizergracht 663, after which the participants will swim together across the canal to the Marineterrein in Amsterdam (Figure 1). Of course, no boats are allowed on this route during the city swim.

In Figure 2 circle markers indicate berths for passenger ships and triangle markers indicate embarkation and disembarkation points for commercial transport. This suggests that if we choose the swim route sensibly, the race will have less impact on commercial water transport and on the route of canal boat trips.

Concerned about the safety of athletes, we can base our discussion on Amber's research. Its research aims to simulate the quality of urban surface water in the Somerlust in Amsterdam and to link water quality to health risks for participants in swimming activities (Figure 3).

According to [the experience of organising the ACS](https://www.amsterdamcityswim.nl/english) and [Waternet's water quality monitoring system](https://www.wereldwaternet.nl/contentassets/6878882b104d4fac8fd131a367e203d6/full-paper-4714541---saskia-holthuijsen.pdf), we give the following advice:
* Participants with open wounds are not allowed to participate in the competition
* First aid and rest stations on the water at 500 metre intervals
* Waternet monitors all aspects of Amsterdam's canal water, such as water quality and sewer overflows
